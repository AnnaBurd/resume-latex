Dear Ms. Thompson,\\

Everyone tells me the entry-level consultant position is any of the Big 4 is going to be the same. However, After attending 5 career fairs and speaking with over 20 professionals, it has become clear to me EY stands out of the rest.\\

What stood out to be that most were the energy levels of all the staff and senior consultants I had the privilege to meet.
Having spent the past 2 summers interning at management consulting firms, I have not only devoted robust problem-solving skills, but also a flair for project management.\\

In my latest role, I was involved in a full life-cycle of a finance project worth US 2M: starting with the initial pitch deck all the way to assisting with a shared service center analysis. In particular, I received recognition for always being on top of deadlines and ensuring client deliverable were on time.\\

Thank you for your time and consideration. My work experiences, coupled with my affinity for project management, would make me an asset to EY's SC Program. I can be easily reached at your convenience by email (\email) or by telephone (\phone).\\

Sincerely,\\\\\\\\\\\\

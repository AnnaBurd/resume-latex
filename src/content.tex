\newcommand{\about}{I discovered a love for programming four years ago when I stumbled upon a book about VBA for Excel and started using macros to automate my daily geology tasks. I love geology, and although it pays well, I had much more fun writing code. Now, with a CS degree and several big projects under my belt, I am making a full-time switch to front-end web development.}
